## Features

- Product Listing: Displaying a list of products with their images, names, prices, and other details retrieved from the Fake Store API.
- Product Details: Displaying detailed information about a selected product, including its description, images, and price.
- Cart Functionality: Allowing users to add products to their cart, view the contents of their cart, update the quantity of products in their cart, and remove products from their cart.
- Redux Toolkit: Utilizing Redux Toolkit, a powerful and opinionated Redux library, to manage the application state in an efficient and scalable way.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring that the website is responsive and can be accessed and used seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
